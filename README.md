# Forking

Github, and similar tools, allow us to create personal copies of other peoples' repositories. We call those copies a `fork` of the original.

When we fork a repo, we're basically asking Github "make me my own copy of this repo please"

As with pull requests, forking is not a Git feature. The ability to fork is implemented by Github.

## Now what?

Now that I've forked, I have my very own copy of the repo where I can do whatever I want!

I can clone my fork and make changes, add features, and break things without fear of disturbing the original repository.

If I do want to share my work, I can make a pull request from my fork to the original repo.
