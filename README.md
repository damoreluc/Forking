# Forking

Github, and similar tools, allow us to create personal copies of other peoples' repositories. We call those copies a `fork` of the original.

When we fork a repo, we're basically asking Github "make me my own copy of this repo please"

As with pull requests, forking is not a Git feature. The ability to fork is implemented by Github.
